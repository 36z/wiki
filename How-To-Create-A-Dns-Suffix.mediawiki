= How to create my own suffix ? =

* If you control the zone file, add those lines :

 namecoin-suffix		IN NS	ns.namecoin-suffix
 ns.namecoin-suffix	IN A	178.32.31.43

* If you can only add subdomains on a registrar panel, add those subdomains :

 subdomain : namecoin-suffix
 type : NS (nameserver)
 value : ns.namecoin-suffix

 subdomain : ns.namecoin-suffix
 type : A (ip address)
 value : 178.32.31.43

Some registrars won't allow you to put NS records. In such a case, it is not possible to create a namecoin suffix.

= How to share my suffix ? =

Add your suffix to the [[List_Of_Suffixes|suffix' list]] or send a mail to "suffix @t dot-bit . org" with :

* the suffix name : namecoin-suffix.your_domain.tld

* a way to contact you : email address or dot-bit forum profile

* optional : country of the suffix

= Do i need to update my suffix ? =

New namecoin servers will be added by the community from time to time and servers can disappear.

So, updating your suffix (each 6 months for example) would help the network to distribute requests among all valid servers.
