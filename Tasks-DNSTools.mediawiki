== NamecoinToBind ==

=== Detailed Description ===
* NamecoinToBind is a php script that generates bind zones for .bit domains from the namecoin blockchain by using the name_scan rpc command.

=== Current status ===
* Status : working
* Last updated: 2011-09-19
* Percentage of completion: 50%
* Sources : https://github.com/khalahan/NamecoinToBind

=== Owner ===
* Name: khalahan

=== Limitations ===
* Supports only initial syntax, not the [[Domain_names|new domain spec]]. Read a little more in the documentation.

=== Scope ===
* A new (rewritten) version that will support the [[Domain_names|new domain spec]] is on the road but far from finished (better resource management and cache usage). Contact me if you are interested.

=== Dependencies ===
* A running namecoin accepting rpc commands
* A bind daemon
