==What is Namecoin==
Namecoin is a distributed naming system based on bitcoin technology (a cryptocurrency).

[[Namecoin]] is a peer-to-peer '''generic''' name/value datastore system based on [http://www.bitcoin.org/ Bitcoin] technology (a decentralized cryptocurrency).
It allows you to:
* Securely register and transfer arbitrary names (keys), '''no possible censorship!'''
* Attach values (data) to the names (up to 1023 bytes)
* Trade and transact namecoins, the digital currency '''NMC'''

There are plenty of possible [[use cases]]. Some examples:

 '''[Name]''' => '''[Value]'''
 DNS: domain_name => domain_zone_configuration
 Identity: user_name => user_public_identity (email, name, gpg key, etc)
 Timestamping: document_hash => document_infos (name, hash, owner, etc)

To register a name, you must own some [[HowToGetNamecoins|namecoins]] (NMC, the internal cryptocurrency used by the software).

==Main features==
* '''distributed/decentralized''': each user has its own copy of the full database
* '''secure''': security (with public/private keys) is deeply integrated in the software to allow only the owner of a name to modify it in the distributed database. 
* '''pseudonymous''': all transfers of data are public and linked to random generated addresses
* '''open''': anybody can use namecoin to register a name or to create its own [[Namespace]]

First release of [http://github.com/namecoin/namecoin namecoin source code] was [http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6017.0  announced on April 18, 2011].

==Projects using Namecoin==
* '''[[Dot-BIT]]''': a domain name system (DNS) using the .bit TLD.
