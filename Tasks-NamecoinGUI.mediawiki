== NamecoinGUI ==

=== Description ===
NamecoinGUI is a Windows GUI for the namecoin daemon written in C#. It allows you to manage accounts, view transactions, register domains and manage the configuration of them (ns forwarding, subdomains, ip, ipv6, alias, etc). It also allows you to manage your bitcoin wallet as well. Upon startup, the program will ask you for the location of the namecoind executable and will ask you to create a username and password. It also asks for the location of the bitcoind executable, but this can be left blank if you don't intend to use the program to manage your bitcoin wallet.
