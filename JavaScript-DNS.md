JavaScript DNS is a client-side/browser DNS resolver which complies with the Namecoin [[domain name specification]].  This is the specification outlining the expected behavior of a jsDNS and any related APIs.

Note that this poorly written specification is written according to [Joel Spolsky's excellent specification specification](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000035.html).  Bad jokes, terrible puns, and revisable facts (i.e. iterations) lay ahead.
