# Mining
Namecoins are mined in the same method as bitcoins and most people practice merged mining wherein Namecoins are mined as a free by-product of Bitcoin mining. Only a few mining pools offer merged mining, see  [Comparison of Mining Pools](http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Comparison_of_mining_pools).

# Exchange
Several exchanges can trade Namecoins for other currencies.
