### Purchasing Bitcoins
***

Coinbase can be used to purchase Bitcoin, which can then be used to exchange for Namecoins. Currently, this is the most convenient way to acquire Namecoins.

### Bitcoin Faucets
***

1. Register account at an exchange that supports trading BTC for NMC.

2. Find free Bitcoin faucets, for example, at Freecoins or getbitcoins there many, and put the bitcoin address of your trading account in all the pages that offer free 0.0001 bitcoins every hour. Repeat and wait for the coins to arrive.

3. Convert your free Bitcoins to some Namecoins!

4. Send them to your namecoin wallet.

5. You can now register names.

As of now you may have to do this up a few times to have enough to register one domain name for a year. This may be only thing you can buy with the micro-bitcoins you obtain from a faucet.
